## NASA Tech Portal Data

This is a small library to extract the patent portfolio data from [NASA's technology transfer site](http://technology.nasa.gov/), using that site's public undocumented API.

The goal of the project is to make it easier for third parties to incorporate NASA's patent library into technology transfer tools so that NASA's intellectual property can be more easily searched and discovered.

It is a work in progress.
