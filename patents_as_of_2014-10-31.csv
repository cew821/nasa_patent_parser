materials and coatings,"Method and system for producing a selected pattern or array of at least one of a single wall nanotube and/or a multi-wall nanotube containing primarily carbon. A substrate is coated with a first layer (optional) of a first selected metal (e.g., Al and/or Ir) and with a second layer of a catalyst (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni and/or Mo), having selected first and second layer thicknesses provided by ion sputtering, arc discharge, laser ablation, evaporation or CVD.

materials and coatings,"Polyimide copolymers were obtained containing 1,3-bis(3-aminophenoxy)benzene (APB) and other diamines and dianhydrides and terminating with the appropriate amount of reactive endcapper. The reactive endcappers studied include but should not be limited to 4-phenylethynyl phthalic anhydride (PEPA), 3-aminophenoxy-4'-phenylethynylbenzophenone (3-APEB), maleic anhydride (MA) and nadic anhydride (5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride, NA). Homopolymers containing only other diamines and dianhydrides which are not processable under conditions described previously can be made processable by incorporating various amounts of APB, depending on the chemical structures of the diamines and dianhydrides used. By simply changing the ratio of APB to the other diamine in the polyimide backbone, a material with a unique combination of solubility, Tg, Tm, melt viscosity, toughness and elevated temperature mechanical properties can be prepared. The copolymers that result from using APB to enhance processability have a unique combination of properties that include low pressure processing (200 psi and below), long term melt stability (several hours at 300.degree. C. for the phenylethynyl terminated polymers), high toughness, improved solvent resistance, improved adhesive properties, and improved composite mechanical properties.

materials and coatings,"Conventional toughening agents are typically rubbery materials or small molecular weight molecules, which mostly sacrifice the intrinsic properties of a matrix such as modulus, strength, and thermal stability as side effects. On the other hand, high modulus inclusions tend to reinforce elastic modulus very efficiently, but not the strength very well. For example, mechanical reinforcement with inorganic inclusions often degrades the composite toughness, encountering a frequent catastrophic brittle failure triggered by minute chips and cracks. Thus, toughening generally conflicts with mechanical reinforcement. Carbon nanotubes have been used as efficient reinforcing agents in various applications due to their combination of extraordinary mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Moreover, nanotubes can elongate more than 20% without yielding or breaking, and absorb significant amounts of energy during deformation, which enables them to also be an efficient toughening agent, as well as excellent reinforcing inclusion.

aeronautics,"A system for emergency aircraft control uses at least one engine and lateral fuel transfer that allows a pilot to regain control over an aircraft under emergency conditions. Where aircraft propulsion is available only through engines on one side of the aircraft, lateral fuel transfer provides means by which the center of gravity of the aircraft can be moved over to the wing associated with the operating engine, thus inducing a moment that balances the moment from the remaining engine, allowing the pilot to regain control over the aircraft. By implementing the present invention in flight control programming associated with a flight control computer (FCC), control of the aircraft under emergency conditions can be linked to the yoke or autopilot knob of the aircraft. Additionally, the center of gravity of the aircraft can be shifted in order to effect maneuvers and turns by spacing such center of gravity either closer to or farther away from the propelling engine or engines. In an alternative embodiment, aircraft having a third engine associated with the tail section or otherwise are accommodated and implemented by the present invention by appropriately shifting the center of gravity of the aircraft. Alternatively, where a four-engine aircraft has suffered loss of engine control on one side of the plane, the lateral fuel transfer may deliver the center of gravity closer to the two remaining engines.

For the GPS implementation, following downconversion to baseband, the signals would be digitized, and all subsequent processing would be digital. In the digital process, residual carriers would be removed and each signal would be correlated with a locally generated model pseudo random-noise code, all following normal GPS procedure. As part of this procedure, accumulated values would be added in software and the resulting signals would be phase-shifted in software by the amounts necessary to synthesize the desired antenna directional gain pattern of peaks and nulls.

In the original intended GPS application, the peaks and nulls could be directed independently for each GPS signal being tracked by the GPS receiver.

information technology and software,"The prognostic tool disclosed here decomposes the problem of estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of a component or sub-system into two separate regression problems: the feature-to-damage mapping and the operational 5 conditions-to-damage-rate mapping. These maps are initially generated in off-line mode. One or more regression algorithms are used to generate each of these maps from measurements (and features derived from these), operational conditions, and ground truth information. This decomposition technique allows for the explicit quantification and management of different sources of uncertainty present in the 10 process. Next, the maps are used in an on-line mode where run-time data (sensor measurements and operational conditions) are used in conjunction with the maps generated in off-line mode to estimate both current damage state as well as future damage accumulation. Remaining life is computed by subtracting the instance when the extrapolated damage reaches the failure threshold from the instance when 15 the prediction is made.

The estimation of remaining useful life (RUL) of a faulty component, is at the center of system prognostics and health management. It gives operators a potent tool in decision making by quanifying how much time is left until functionality is lost. This is especially true for aerospace systems, where unanticipated subsystem downtime may lead to catastrophic failures. In situations where the cost/benefit analysis of using physics-based damage propagation algorithms is not favorable and when sufficient test data are available that map out the damage space, one can employ data0-driven approaches or a combination of data-driven and model-based (hybrid) techniques. Conventional data-driven approaches attempt to learn the health degradation pattern of the system directly form sensor measurements and to extrapolate that to find RUL. These methods are frequently susceptible to artifacts in training data as well as unanticipated future operational conditions. The prognostic tool developed by us decomposes the prognostic problem into two separate regression problems: the feature to damage mapping and the operational conditions to damage rate mapping. Several regression algorithms like Neural Networks (NN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), etc., are used to solve each of thes subtasks.
