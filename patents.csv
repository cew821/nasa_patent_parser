A method for joining or repairing boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs).  In joining BNNTs, the nanotube structure is modified with amorphous carbon deposited by controlled electron beam irradiation to form well bonded hybrid a-C/BNNT structures.  In repairing BNNTs, the damaged site of the nanotube structure is modified with amorphous carbon deposited by controlled electron beam irradiation to form well bonded hybrid a-C/BNNT structures at the damaged site.",Amorphous Carbon-Boron Nitride Nanotube Hybrids,LAR-18143-1,LARC,,"13/694,286",2032-11-15 00:00:00,NASA Langley Research Center,Office of Partnership Development,MS 218,,"Hampton, VA 23681-2199",Sandra Pretlow,Sandra.k.pretlow@nasa.gov,(757) 864-2358
